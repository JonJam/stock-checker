## Overview
Inspired by [How To Get a PlayStation 5 When It's Always Out of Stock](https://dev.to/marisayou/how-to-get-a-playstation-5-when-it-s-always-out-of-stock-5d4i).

This app periodically checks various retailers in the United Kingdom to see if they have an Xbox Series X console in stock. 

If any do, it will send a SMS to a configured mobile number.
